//this was important because every class needs to have a NoArgsConstrcutor for Hibernate/JPA
/*Why does Hibernate (JPA) need a no-argument constructor?
Hibernate needs a no-argument constructor for each of your entity classes (like Project) because of how it works internally:

Object creation via reflection: When Hibernate reads data from the database, it needs to create ("instantiate") an object of your entity class. It does this without using the usual new keyword, but instead by calling the no-argument constructor through Java reflection.

Population in multiple steps: Hibernate first creates an empty entity instance (just with the no-arg constructor), and after that, it sets each entity field using reflection or property setters.

This is required because, at the moment of object creation, Hibernate doesn't have all the field values—it gets them one by one from the database row.*/

    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)

/*Lombok emits a warning in your error output:


"@Builder will ignore the initializing expression entirely. If you want the initializing expression to serve as default, add @Builder.Default."

This means your builder will NOT apply your default initializations (like new Date()) unless you annotate those fields with @Builder.Default.


 For Lombok's @Builder to work well with JPA entities, you should usually:

Add @NoArgsConstructor (MANDATORY for JPA)

Add @AllArgsConstructor or define your own constructor if necessary

Avoid or be careful with inline initialization of fields

Sometimes switch to a more explicit builder configuration if you want full control*/
